# Transfer Learning Studies

Here I look at 3 different event numbers, both with and without transfer learning, all using the 1D flow surrogate
- 700
- 50
- 5

Due to significantly divergent evolution behaviour in some case, averaged plots can be misleading, so I present both the averaged and some individual plots as needed.

## 700 Events

### Transfer Learning

- standard behaviour with initial increase of absorber followed by increase in scintillator, plateauing at 25
- low run-to-run variation

### No Transfer Learning

- huge run-to-run variation

#### Runs 0 - 2
